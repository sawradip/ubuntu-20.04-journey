I discovered some errors on my EC2 instance two days ago; the nvidia driver is not working properly. The error message was “NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it could not communicate with the NVIDIA driver.” Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running.

And I tried several ways to solve it, but it still did not work. So, after much searching, I discovered it!

This is the approach I take to solving it:
```
\# First of all, we need to remove all of the previous dependencies  
sudo apt-get purge nvidia-\*  
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get autoremove
```
Then you need to find the suitable nvidia-driver version. Run this command
```
\# Then find the suitable version of nvidia driver  
ubuntu-drivers devices  
\# or  
apt search nvidia-driver
```
And the results will look like this

In my option, I would like to use nvidia-driver-470, but I got some issues on dependencies, therefore I tried to use nvidia-driver-470-server instead and it works.
```
\# Installing the driver  
sudo apt install libnvidia-common-470  
sudo apt-get -y install libnvidia-gl-470  
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470-server
```
After installing all of the prerequisites listed above, you must run
```
sudo reboot
```
Also, ensure that the nvidia-driver is properly installed
```
nvidia-smi
```
If it is installed correctly, something like this will appear.
