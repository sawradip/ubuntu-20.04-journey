When I downloaded Stremio .deb file, add run `sudo apt install`. Was showing various errors.

Solutions:
- For deb files, if the repository in not added, shows dependency error. manually intall those dependencies.
- Root doesn't have proper access to all the dolders, such as `/home/${USER}` or '/home/${USER}/Downloads`. To solve, create a folder, such as '/home/${USER}/temp`, move the .deb files there, and install from there.
- To run stremio as server version, use docker image, https://askubuntu.com/questions/1403911/stremio-doesnt-launch-on-ubuntu-22-04
